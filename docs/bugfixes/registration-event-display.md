# Registration and Event Display Bug Fixes

## Issue Overview

The application was experiencing an issue where registrations would display "Unknown Event" in the registration listing and when creating/updating registrations, even when valid event information was provided.

## Root Causes

1. **Event ID Mismatch**: There was a mismatch between the event IDs in the mock events (`evt-001`, `evt-002`, `evt-003`) and the mock registrations (`event-1`, `event-2`, `event-3`).

2. **Incomplete Event Data Association**: When creating or updating a registration, the frontend code was not properly attaching the complete event object to the registration data.

3. **Missing Event Data Preservation**: The registration API was not preserving event data during operations like check-in or updates.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Event ID Alignment

- Updated the mock events in `eventApi.js` to use consistent IDs (`event-1`, `event-2`, `event-3`) to match with registration data
- Ensured the mock ticket types also referenced the correct event IDs

```javascript
// Modified event IDs in mockEvents array
const mockEvents = [
  {
    id: "event-1", // Changed from evt-001
    name: "Tech Conference 2024",
    // Other properties...
  },
  // Other events...
];

// Updated ticket types to use the matching event IDs
const mockTicketTypes = [
  {
    id: "general",
    name: "General Admission",
    price: 50,
    description: "Standard entry ticket",
    eventId: "event-1", // Changed from evt-001
  },
  // Other ticket types...
];
```

### 2. Enhanced Registration Data Management

- Modified the registration creation and update processes to properly attach event information:

```javascript
// Find the corresponding event object and attach it to the registration
const matchingEvent = events.find(
  (event) => event.id === newRegistration.eventId
);

// Create an enhanced registration with event data
const enhancedRegistration = {
  ...newRegistration,
  event: matchingEvent || null,
  eventName: matchingEvent ? matchingEvent.name : "Unknown Event",
};
```

### 3. API Integration Improvements

- Added proper error handling and CORS configuration for all API instances
- Implemented request and response interceptors for better error management
- Set up consistent authentication handling across all API calls

```javascript
// Setup for API instances with CORS and authentication
const setupInstance = (instance) => {
  // Request interceptor with auth and CORS headers
  instance.interceptors.request.use(
    (config) => {
      // Add auth header if token exists
      const token = localStorage.getItem("token");
      if (token) {
        config.headers["Authorization"] = `Bearer ${token}`;
      }

      // Add CORS headers
      config.headers["Access-Control-Allow-Origin"] = "*";
      config.headers["Access-Control-Allow-Methods"] =
        "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS";
      config.headers["Access-Control-Allow-Headers"] =
        "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization";

      return config;
    },
    (error) => {
      console.error("Request error:", error);
      return Promise.reject(error);
    }
  );

  // Response interceptor for handling errors
  instance.interceptors.response.use(
    (response) => response,
    (error) => {
      // Handle 401 errors by clearing token and redirecting
      if (error.response && error.response.status === 401) {
        localStorage.removeItem("token");
        window.location.href = "/login";
      }
      return Promise.reject(error);
    }
  );
};
```

### 4. Event Data Preservation

- Enhanced the check-in functionality to maintain event information
- Modified the `RegistrationCard` component to handle different ways the event name could be stored

```javascript
// Get event name from multiple possible sources in RegistrationCard
let eventName = "Unknown Event";
if (registration.event?.name) {
  eventName = registration.event.name;
} else if (registration.event?.title) {
  eventName = registration.event.title;
} else if (registration.eventName) {
  eventName = registration.eventName;
}
```

### 5. Loading Sequence Optimization

- Updated the sequence of data loading to ensure events are loaded before registrations
- Ensured that all registrations are enhanced with event data after loading

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  loadEvents().then(() => {
    loadAttendees();
    loadRegistrations();
  });
}, []);
```

## Results

After implementing these fixes:

- All registrations now display the correct event name in the registrations list
- Creating new registrations correctly associates them with the selected event
- Updating registrations maintains the event association
- The check-in process preserves all event information

These changes have significantly improved data consistency and user experience across the registration workflow.
